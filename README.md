# Racquel
A collection of Minecraft cheats built to train an up-and-coming Minecraft AntiCheat. 

This is/was created as part of freelance contracting for a large Minecraft network looking to improve their AntiCheat infrastructure.

## Why release a Minecraft cheat client?

This is in no way advertised to be used by cheaters, and will contain no guides on actually setting it up. The point of releasing this code is to
improve the understanding of how Minecraft cheats operate, for the purpose of creating AntiCheats.

What anyone does with this software is on them. I explicitly do not condone any usage with malicious intent.

## Why call it Racquel?
 
Years ago I [wrote private AntiCheat plugins](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/the-4-year-late-postmortem-of-an-advanced-aimbot-detection-system/) 
for a few large Minecraft networks. The shared source between these different projects was named Rita, paying Homeage to the first poster of Rita
 Hayworth that Andy Dufrane hangs in his cell during The Shawshank Redemption. 
 
As this software is on the other end of the pipeline, I decided to name it Racquel, after the poster Andy Dufrane of Racquel Welch had in his cell
 during his escape.
